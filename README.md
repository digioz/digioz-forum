# DigiozBB
Welcome to DigiozBB (Digioz Bulletin Board), an open-source forum software that aims to create a feature-rich, modern, and user-friendly bulletin board system for everyone. The DigiozBB (DigiOz Bulletin Board) is an old fashion forums system modeled after PHPBB (PHP Bulletin Board). The goal here is to take an existing well established Bulletin Board system and bring it over to the Microsoft .NET Core Stack which is also cross platform but with a lot more modern features and functionality. 

The development stack for the project is as follows:

2. Microsoft .NET Core 8.0
3. Microsoft SQL Server 2022
