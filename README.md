# DigiozBB
Welcome to DigiozBB (Digioz Bulletin Board), an open-source forum software that aims to create a feature-rich, modern, and user-friendly bulletin board system for everyone. The DigiozBB (Digioz Bulletin Board) is an old-fashioned forum system modeled after PHPBB (PHP Bulletin Board). The goal here is to take an existing well-established Bulletin Board system and bring it over to the Microsoft .NET Core Stack, which is also cross-platform but with a lot more modern features and functionality.

The development stack for the project is as follows:

1. Visual Studio 2022
2. Microsoft .NET Core 9.0
3. Microsoft SQL Server 2022
